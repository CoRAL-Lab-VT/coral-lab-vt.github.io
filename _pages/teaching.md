The CoRAL Lab trains the next generation workforce of compound flood modelers at different learner stages.

<u><b>Undergraduate and Graduate Level Teaching:</b></u>

- <b>CEE 3814: Analytical Tools in Civil and Environmental Engineering.</b> Spring semester. Students learn the basics of Python programing with a focus on statistical analysis.

- <b>CEE 5364: Compound Flood Hazard Modeling.</b> Fall semester. Students are trained in statistical and physics-based modeling approaches to simulate hurricane-induced flooding and assess inherent hazards and risks.

    Graduate students receive specialized training in compound flood modeling and hazard assessment. Every Fall, graduate students learned how to simulate pluvial, fluvial, and coastal flooding and design flood hazard scenarios by linking statistical analysis and 2D hydrodynamic modeling. So proud of this new generation of flood modelers! #GoHokies

<u><b>Outreach:</b></u>

The CoRAL lab develops compound flood experiments and hands-on activities to educate elementary and middle schoolers about hurricanes, flooding, flood adaptation, and wetland resilience strategies.
