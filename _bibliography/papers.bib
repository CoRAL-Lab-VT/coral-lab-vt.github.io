abstract = {With the increase of tropical cyclone activity, coastal communities will experience growing impacts from extreme water levels and associated compound flooding. Multiple drivers contribute to total water level (TWL), including mean sea level, astronomical tides, riverine flow, storm surges, and waves. Therefore, gaining insight into future TWL variability requires a thorough understanding of how those drivers nonlinearly interact at different spatiotemporal scales. In this study, we developed a coupled coastal and wave model at sufficient spatial resolution to analyze: (i) tide–driver interactions and their nonlinear components stemming from surge, river flow, and wind-waves, and (ii) their spatiotemporal evolution across the pre-landfall, landfall, and post-landfall stages of tropical cyclones in the Chesapeake Bay, USA. Results show that tide–surge and tide–wave interactions, along with their nonlinear components, exhibit substantial annual variability, with extreme hurricanes producing abrupt and spatially distinct responses driven by low pressure anomalies in slow-moving storms and wind setup in faster systems. In contrast, tide–river interactions remain negligible except in the upper bay tributaries. A weak or neutral tide–driver interaction does not necessarily indicate a negligible nonlinear response. Rather, nonlinear interactions (NIs) generally act out of phase with their associated drivers, functioning as compensatory mechanisms that amplify or suppress TWL. These nonlinearities are transient and of high-frequency nature near the coast, but evolve into slower, more persistent fluctuations in upstream regions. As climate change reshapes coastal dynamics, a robust understanding of NIs is essential for designing effective flood protection, enhancing risk assessments, and developing informed adaptation strategies for extreme water levels.}

abstract = {Accurate prediction of extreme water level (EWL) dynamics resulting from cyclone-induced events is critical for mitigating coastal flood hazards, yet existing approaches remain constrained by computationally expensive hydrodynamic models. While recent deep learning (DL) models can achieve high accuracy and reduced computational cost, they often fail to capture delayed hydrodynamic responses across large water bodies and/or generalize EWL dynamics across distinct spatial domains. In this study, we present a transferable DL framework designed to propagate EWLs in estuaries and bays using sparse tide-gauges as water level sources. The framework evaluates the model’s performance of the proposed Attention-based Gated Graph Convolution Network (AbGGCN) against a U-Net model with a convolutional long short-term memory network (ConvLSTM) and a conventional GGCN. These models embed sparse tide-gauges in the model domain and utilize convolutional or graph diffusion operators that learn how localized EWL signals spread across space and time, with the AbGGCN model incorporating a custom temporal attention mechanism. We demonstrate that the AbGGCN model outperforms both the U-Net ConvLSTM and GGCN models with accuracies comparable to those from physics-based model simulations (e.g., Mean Kling-Gupta Efficiency: 0.71 vs. 0.50 and 0.46, and Mean Bias: +0.04 m vs. + 0.14 and + 0.12 m, respectively, for Hurricane Beryl, 2024). Moreover, AbGGCN exhibits strong model transferability when trained in Galveston Bay, TX and tested in Chesapeake Bay, VA-MD without additional retraining. Our findings suggest that spatiotemporal graph-based architectures are scalable, efficient, and generalizable alternatives for real-time EWL forecasting, with broad applicability to diverse estuarine and coastal systems.}
